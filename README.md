# JavaScript-30-Challenge
My attempt on #JavaScript30 by Wes Bos

Day 1 - Refreshed on manipulating the DOM using vanilla js.  Created a cool drum kit.

Day 2 - Created a JS clock.  Learned about transform-origin, the CSS property.

Day 3 - Created a page that updates CSS variables using JS.  Getting a better understanding of how to interconnect the two.

Day 4 - Reviewed javascript methods .filter, .map, .sort and .reduce.  Also used methods to extract data from a wikipedia page.  

Day 5 - More of a CSS lesson.  Reviews flexbox contents and uses transitions to make a photo gallery.  Getting a better understanding of toggling classes.
